* Trying with and without a bug fix with where suggested on nimble-users
** WITHOUT SUGGESTED FIX  -  USE BRANCH "whereBugged"
*** R CMD check gives
    buildAPT: no visible binding for global variable ‘sampler_APT’
*** buildAPT in APT_demo_DEBUG.R gives
    Error in getClass(Class, where = topenv(parent.frame())) : 
  “nfRefClass_R_GlobalEnv45” is not a defined class
** WITH SUGGESTED FIX  -  USE BRANCH "suggestedFix"
*** This does enable the problem line in APT_demo_DEBUG to run
*** BUT...
*** roxygenize() then started giving 
    Error in assign(mname, def, where) : 
      cannot add bindings to a locked environment
** I added "methods" to some @import arguments and roxygenize() started giving 
    Error in assignClassDef(Class, classDef, where) : 
      class “nfRefClass_NimbleSnippets43” has a locked definition in package ‘NimbleSnippets’
** It may be possible to use roxygenise without the where fix and the swap the where arguments.
* Adding nimble in DESCRIPTION is important
** Without
> roxygenize()
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : 
  could not find function "nimbleFunction"
** With
